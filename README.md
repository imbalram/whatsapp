Have you ever wished to automatically wish your friends on their birthdays, or send a set of messages to your friend ( or any Whastapp contact! ) automatically at a pre-set time, or send your friends by sending thousands of random text on whatsapp! Using Browser Automation you can do all of it and much more!
     </br>First you must install these:-</br>
<b>1) Python Bindings for Selenium ( Browser Automation software )</b></br>
pip install selenium</br>
<b>2) Chrome webdriver</b></br>
Download Chrome driver from here: <a href="https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.25/" width="400" height="300">Chromedriver download page</a>( choose your specific version )</br>
Extract it in a known location , as we need the location later</br>
If you get stuck somewhere, Don't forget to ping me</br>
<b>3) Chromium Web Browser( Open source version of chrome browser )</b></br>
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser</br>
Thatâ€™s it! You are all set.</br>

Then Run the script ( make sure that you have added the absolute path for chromedriver and have replaced target variable with your friends name ). Scan the QR code that appears on the screen and enjoy the power of python!</br>
<b>Please use this script only for educational purposes, i am not responsible if your friends ( or even Whatsapp ) block you.</b></br>
Feel free to modify the code. Try to :</br>
1)Text Multiple Groups at once</br>
2)Send the messages from a predefined list of messages randomly or</br>
3)Send complete random text.</br>
